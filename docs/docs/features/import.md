# Import

## Overview

LiveCodes supports importing code from a wide variety of sources.

The Import screen can be accessed from the settings menu â†’ Import.

![LiveCodes Import](../../static/img/screenshots/import.jpg)

Alternatively, a URL of any of the sources can be imported on-load by adding it as a value to query string key: `x`, for example:

https://livecodes.io/?x=https://gist.github.com/f01deb828a42f363502fbae7964d48e9

## Sources

Import is supported from any of the following:

- GitHub gist
- GitHub file
- Directory in a GitHub repo
- Gitlab snippet
- Gitlab file
- Directory in a Gitlab repo
- JS Bin
- Raw code
- Code in web page DOM
- Code in zip file
- [Exported project JSON](./export.md) (single project and bulk import)

Import sources are identified by URL patterns (e.g. origin, pathname and extension).

## File Selection

For sources that provide multiple files (e.g. GitHub/GitLab directories, gists, zip files, etc), a best guess is tried to load files in respective editors. Best results are when there are 3 files each is in a language (identified by file extension) that can be loaded to a different editor, for example:

- index.html, style.css, script.js
- default.pug, app.scss, main.ts

Markup files starting with `index.`, style files starting with `style.` and script files starting with `script.` are given higher priority. While Markup files starting with `readme.` are given lower priority.

languages & files can be specified by [query params](../configuration/query-params.md):

?x={url}&{language1}={file1}&{language2}={file2}&{language3}={file3}

## Import Code from DOM

If the source is not identified, the URL is fetched, its response text is parsed as HTML and code is extracted from elements that match specific CSS selectors.  
(By default: `.livecodes [data-lang="{language}"]`)

:::info Example

```html
<code class="livecodes">
  <pre data-lang="html">This is identified as &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; code</pre>
</code>
```

The HTML editor is prefilled with: `This is identified as <strong>HTML</strong> code`

:::

Notice that the code should be html-encoded to avoid interference with the HTML of the page.

Example:

https://livecodes.io/?x=https://live-codes.github.io/livecodes-examples/prefill-from-code-blocks.html

Custom CSS selectors can be specified for elements that contain the code for specific languages, using query params `{language}-selector`. The following example loads the content of the first element that matches the CSS selector `h3` as the HTML code:

https://livecodes.io/?html-selector=h3&x=https://live-codes.github.io/livecodes-examples/prefill-from-code-blocks.html

Please note that you may prefill LiveCodes editors embedded in the same page. This works great for documentation websites.

[This is a demo](https://live-codes.github.io/livecodes-examples/prefill-from-code-blocks.html) for automatic extraction of code blocks to prefill editors by creating "Edit in LiveCodes" links. Also embedded editors are prefilled from the code blocks. ([View source](https://github.com/live-codes/livecodes-examples/blob/master/prefill-from-code-blocks.html))

## Import Raw Code

it is assumed to be raw code and the response text is loaded to an editor. If the URL ends with an extension it is used to identify the language, otherwise it is assumed to be `html`. The language of raw code can be specified by query param `raw`:

?x={url}&raw=python
