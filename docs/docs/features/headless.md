# Headless Mode

The LiveCodes [SDK](../sdk/index.md) can be used to create playgrounds in headless mode. In this mode, no visible output is displayed in the embedding web page. However, all [SDK methods](../sdk/js-ts.md#sdk-methods) are accessible (e.g. updating code, getting compiled code, getting the console output, getting the result page HTML, getting shareable URLs, formatting code, running tests, etc).

This provides the power of leveraging the wide range of features and language support offered by LiveCodes, while retaining full control over what gets displayed.
